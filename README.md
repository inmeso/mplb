The multi-platform lattice Boltzmann code (MPLB) is a lattice Boltzmann solver written by using the oxford parallel library for structured mesh solvers (OPS).  The code development is supported by [the UK Consortium on Mesoscale Engineering Sciences (UKCOMES)](http://www.ukcomes.org/). By utilizing the functionalities of the OPS library, the code is capable of running on heterogeneous computing platform, and supporting finite-difference lattice Boltzmann models. We are continually developing new functionalities into the code, including high-order lattice Boltzmann models, coupling scheme for solid-fluid two-phase flows etc.

The MPLB code is also a backend code of the [HiLeMMS project](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/P022243/1), see [here](https://gitlab.com/jpmeng/hilemms). We can assemble application by utilising the HiLeMMS interface, please see Manual.md
